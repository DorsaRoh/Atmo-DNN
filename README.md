## Determining if Life is Possible on a Planet

The following are the general encompassing criteria for a planet to sustain life,
thus they are the main objectives to determine.

1. Predicting Atmospheric Conditions of Planet
- Inputs: 
    - Semi-Major Axis	
    - Planet Radius	
    - Planet Density	
    - Planet Surface Pressure	
    - kappa	
    - gamma1	
    - gamma2	
    - alpha	beta	
    - Planet Surface Temperature
    - Avg Mol Weight	
    - Mean Surface Albedo

- Outputs:
    - CH4 abundance	
    - N2O abundance	
    - CO abundance	
    - O3 abundance	
    - SO2 abundance	
    - NH3 abundance	
    - C2H6 abundance	
    - NO2 abundance	

2. Predicting presence of liquid water
3. Predicting the stability of climate
4. Predicting the presence of a magnetic field
5. Predicting planet's distance from its host star
