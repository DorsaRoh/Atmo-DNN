### Determines the conditions of a planet; conditions needed to support life.

A collection of deep learning and machine learning models that predict and determine a planet/exoplanet's potential to sustain carbon-based life.
  
The following are the general encompassing criteria for a planet to sustain life,
thus they are what <i>isLife</i> determines:

1. Predicting atmospheric conditions of planet
2. Predicting quality of liquid water, if present
3. Predicting the stability of climate
4. Predicting the presence of a magnetic field
5. Predicting planet's distance from its host star
