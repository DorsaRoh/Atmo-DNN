### Determines the conditions of a planet; conditions needed to support life*.
<i>*carbon-based life forms</i>

  
The following are the general encompassing criteria for a planet to sustain life,
thus they are the main objectives to determine:

1. Predicting atmospheric conditions of planet
2. Predicting quality of liquid water, if present
3. Predicting the stability of climate
4. Predicting the presence of a magnetic field
5. Predicting planet's distance from its host star
