# Atmo

### _Atmo_ is a deep learning model built **from scratch**. 

Its main objective is to determine the atmospheric conditions/chemical composition of planets and stars. Aims to identify exoplanets with conditions supportive of carbon-based life, and explore other means of determining chemical compositions of atmospheres without light.
